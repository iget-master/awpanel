# AWPanel

This repository is about creating a server administration tool made to work exclusively with AWS services for web hosting.

Currently, there's no tools that are created to use AWS services as back-end for a web hosting, although there's a lot of AWS services that replace many of your web hosting concerns, like DNS, Database, Caching, Email, CDN, Storage and a lot of other things.

## Ideas

All ideas about this project will be created as issues to be discussed with interested people, and will be tagged with the `idea` tag.

I have no plans about what language to use to develop it. I like developing in PHP and love the advances that this language made in last years. In other hand, [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) doesn't support it natively, and I like the Lambda so I'll try to use it on this project.

## Licensing

This project is licensed under [MIT license](LICENSE), and I pretend to make it opensource forever and develop some private plugins in a far future.
